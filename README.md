# About This Project

## The project was developed as part of my coursework for Digital Forensics/Cybersecurity II

**For this Project, there are three branches that you can explore:**

Project scope and plan,

Project debriefing, and 

Final work. 

**In the project scope and plans branch**, you will find valuable information that will help you understand the goals, objectives, tasks, and timelines involved in the Project.

**Moving on to the Project debrief branch**, we will review the successes and challenges faced during the Project, analyze the outcomes, and discuss any improvements that could be made for future projects.

**Lastly, in the final work branch**, you will find the project report and manuals of the code use and web application, as well as the Project's outcome.

Furthermore, I have added a Google Drive link that will navigate to a recorded .mp4 file demonstrating our web application attack from start to end. Here is the link:

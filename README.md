# Project Scope and Plan
 
## Project Idea

We plan to create a vulnerable web application for this project that performs Scapy network attacks on the visitor's local network.

**Research Needed**

How to deploy in the cloud or the local host.
How to conduct the attacks on the machine.
How to attack the network the machine is on using Scapy.

**Technical Tools (Software, programming languages, etc.)**

HTML 

CSS

JavaScript

Python(Scapy)

Ubuntu, and

Kali

**Development Required**

We need to develop a web application with malicious and vulnerable code. 
Develop Scapy scripts for attacks.
A listening port is needed to connect the site visitor's and hacker's computers.
 
**Group Member Roles and Responsibilities**

List each group member and what they will contribute to the project.
In this project, 

**Md Jayadul Islam** will build the web application using HTML, CSS, JS, and a network scanning and network attack script.

**Jonathin Casanova** will write the Scapy script for various attacks like network scanning, Arp Spoofing/Man-in-the-middle, and HTTP sniffing. 

**Sourav Das** will test the attack on the web application. 
 
**Weekly Milestones**

List what you plan to accomplish each remaining week to complete your project and meet the mid-semester and final deliverable submissions.
In our first week, we plan to make our web application functional by putting our Scapy script in the web application.
In our second week, we will work on the Scapy script with various attacks and put these scripts in the web application. 
In the third week, we will make our front and back end functional and be ready to demonstrate the attack for submission.
